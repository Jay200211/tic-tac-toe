Tic Tac Toe in Go
Iâ€™ve just completed my  project in Golang: a classic Tic Tac Toe game!  This project is a simple yet fun implementation of the traditional 3x3 grid game where two players (X and O) take turns to mark spaces on the grid. The game checks for a winner after each move or declares a draw if all spaces are filled without a winner.

Features:
Two-player mode: Play against another person on the same machine.
Winner Detection: Automatically checks for horizontal, vertical, and diagonal winning combinations.
Draw Detection: Ends the game if all grid positions are filled with no winner.
